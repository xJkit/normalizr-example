# Normalizr Example
Different JSON data:
1. __articles.json__ (Official tutorial)
2. __songs.json__ (Actual example from YouTube)

Use __``express.js``__ as backend server to respond json data object. Use __``normalizr``__ to make them flat.

To kick off, install node packages by __npm__:
```
npm i
```
To fire up server, use __nodemon__:
```
npm start
```
Then you go! Feel free to append your fake data in the __./mockdata__ folder, and don't forget to add an entry point of the api server for that data.
